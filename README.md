# Neural-Network-from-scratch-for-handwriting-recognition-in-MNIST-dataset-
Neural Network built using Python and understanding the mathematical concepts behind implementation of the same.

- The project involves building a Neural Network from scratch after watching a Youtube follow along tutorial.
- To build the Neural Network, the project follows a 3-part process, Forward Propagation, Backward Propagation, and Updating the parameters.
- However, I came across countless errors while implementing the project inside google colab. Thankfully, the tutorial was also posted on Kaggle, where several others faced similar issues to what I faced. Finally, the errors were resolved after going through every aspect of the code and the math behind it.
- At early stages, the Neural Network would stop training because of reshaping issues of arrays in the complete code, and hence providing an empty array during runtime, with a model accuracy of mere ~10%. However, further I improved some of the functions after looking over the forum. Further, after several hours of error resolving the project was executed succesfully, and was able to detect the handwritings with a model accuracy of ~90%.

The project was done for learning purposes only.
